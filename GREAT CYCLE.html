  <h1>THE GREAT CYCLE OF 3 2000 YEAR PERIODS</h1>

  <h2>There are several issues which expand the histories of all the ancient nations with the exception of the Hebrew-Israelite-Jewish nation.  In other words, over the centuries, the intellectual establishment has shortened the Hebrew-Israelite-Jewish history of the Bible while the history of the world and the other nations reach backward further and further.</h2>
  <h2>0. The first Great Cycle from 4000 BC to 2000 BC is hopelessly opaque with little but some Bible comment and evolutionary ages expanding geometrically or exponentially toward the origin of space and time.</h2>
  <h2>1. For all dates previous to the terminal historical date of 2000 BC all histories begin to expand at some geometrical or even exponential rate.  The actual dates of that exapnsionism lies somewhere between 2000 BC and 2350 BC about after the deluge of Noah.</h2>
  <h2>2. Floyd Nolan Jones has resolved all but a few of the large number of chronological problems of which the Bible is supposedly guilty.  Whatever implausibilities remain are not contradictions but implausibilities which are one and all only even implausible because no witnesses remain to make physics models.  For instance, the great ages of the patriarchs only seem impossible because nobody with an MD degree was there to check their body chemistry, genetic composition or environment.</h2>
  <h2>3. The puzzling lack of fit among ancient civilizations occurred because the Assyrian satrapies of Egypt each ran about 125 more or less years.  Once the lengths of dynasties XX, XXI, XXII and XXIII are taken as parallel dynasties, the fit becomes rather easy.</h2>
  <h2>4. Edwin Thiele wrongly extracted 46 years more or less from the Old TEstament because of  an pobviously in retrospect reading that Ahab is found on a monument of Tiglathpileser III</h2>
  <h2>5. Floyd Nolan Jones has proven conclusively that the period from the viziership of Joseph to the Exodus under Moses was just more than two centuries and not just more than four centuries.  Abraham then was born in about 1996 BC about more or less</h2>
  <h2>6. Mesopotamian chronological errors probably range from a few centuries downward.  Egyptian chronological dates are now probably good to within a decade or two thanks to Jim Reilly</h2>
  <h2>7. Once we make the previous 6 adjustments, we arrive at a chart which demonstrates parallelism with the modern era.  This as a pioneering chart probably contains lots of errors.  Some of the correspondences are virtually foolproof I predict.  the two scientific revolutions with the two Renaissances are secure.  Joseph is next to Constantine.  Christ is next to Abraham.  Pope Gregory VII is next to David and Solomon.  MOses is next to St. Benedict.  The Protestant Reformation is next to the second temple period. There is some complex relationship between God'd people as a strand and the other nations.</h2>
  <h2>7. cont.  Another probable complex problem would be that the point of ancient history for both Jews and gentiles was to demonstrate failure.  The gospel era produces success.  The first gospel era as Oswald Spengler probably noticed was that the world as filthy bubble helped purify the church repeatedly.  The gospel era then solved the problem of how to navigate between infinity and the finite.  The ancient era in Mesopotamia produced the world as a multiplex of facts.  The Mesopotamians learned how to integrate huge numbers of all sizes of economic units doing all kinds of economic business.  The Egyptians saw the world as a river with eternal cycles and complex layers.  Applied to mummies they thought the deceased could live with ka, ba, body and so forth properly superposed.  The second half of the ancient world was dominated by thinking that a heroic act at a moment in time provided immortality.  Dying in the act of the hero was as good as it got.</h2>
  <h2>8. India, China and other cultures have contributed.  India majored upon illusions.  The Chinese gave the world that a path to the goal might wander as long as it gets to the goal</h2>
