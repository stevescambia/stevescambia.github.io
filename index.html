    <p>The Bible presents a cosmology in which material reality lies embedded within a far more comprehensive spiritual reality.  There exists a created order or many created orders within Spiritual reality.  The only existence which is not created is God.  God reveals himself as a collective at some times in the Bible and as a unity as other times in the Bible.  God claims to have written the Bible.  The Bible claims to form one of the many communications between the infinity of God and the finite creatures of the human race who lie embedded within material reality.  In the time of the latter day saints who form a subset of the human race, the characteristic of those people is that God in His grace has impregnated those people with faith.  The traditional formula is that God as a living, choosing and empowering being impregnates those individuals through the power of the Holy Ghost.  The Holy Ghost is one of the manifestations of the collective.    The Holy Ghost forms with the Father and Son the three elements of the unity.  God is not like limited dysfunctional humans who act in imperfect ways.  God is holy.  The holiness of God means that God acts along a trajectory such that the whole trajectory and each and every individual part of the trajectory conform to his attribute of holiness.  God is trustworthy, without contradiction, without disharmony, loving, just, omniscient, omnipotent, perfect in everyway and trajectory of act as well as in the acts which compose the trajectory.  When God communicates with his human creatures, God restricts himself to demonstrating their need to depend upon him upon many forms of proof.  One form of proof is that the Bible is an organic unity despite the very large number of human coauthors.  God was a coauthor with all of those human coauthors.  For the Bible to be true, all of the claims of the Bible must be true.  One claim in the Bible is that the trajectory of history from the time that material reality was created until the consummation of all things is that God has created the trajectory of history.  It would be impossible to be born of God without that new birth implanting within the born again individual the property or the compulsion above all other compulsions to obey and love God.  Consequently, the traditional debate concerning faith and works serves as a mere tempest in a tea pot.  Faith, hope, love, obedience and other motivations described in the Bible are descriptions of a property or properties implanted as part of the new birth.  An individual who has experienced the new birth is traditionally called Christian.  The life of an individual consists of the metaphysical inner aspects of their life with the phenomenal aspects.  Phenomena are the aspects of life which occur such that other beings can experience.  Sensate experience informs us of phenomena.  We experience each other through sensate phenomena.  God among other modes of communications uses the Bible through the work of the Holy Ghost to enlighten our love, faith, hope and obedience.  The trajectory of history and the components of the trajectory of history in the Bible become the various components of an overall message.</p>
  
    <p>I was born in 1947 AD.  At that time, materialists had been committing enormous resources to the destruction of the credibility of the history of the Bible.  God in the Bible demonstrates that God is the providential creator and providential omnipotent being who by his own ingenious creativity has created the trajectory of material reality as well as the creation of material reality.  This work at least until further notice will consider many topics beyond the scope of our investigation.  One topic beyond the scope of our investigation will be the topic of origins.  The boundary between origins as an investigation and history as an investigation are permeable.  What I call history is consequently partially a subjective concept.  A second topic we will consider beyond the scope of this investigation will be the debate over whether a human being can be born again as saved and then not attain eternal bliss.  I will accept as axiomatic that nobody who is born again by impregnation with the life of the God-man-Christ can possibly not feel compelled to love, obey, and hope in Him.  The new birth implants some one or more properties in humans who then have become Christians by the new birth.  Like gravity is a property inherent in mass, love and obedience are a property inherent in the new birth.  Mass did not earn the property of gravity.  God at creation of Godâ€™s own free will and His own action gave mass the property of gravitational attraction.  Nobody earned the new birth nor the properties of love to God and obedience to God.  God implanted by his own choice and action the new birth with the property that the person of the new birth is compelled to love and obey.  Love and obedience like gravitational force cause works and other phenomena which people can experience.  Mass cannot possess the property of gravitational attraction without attracting other masses.  Work and other phenomena are inevitable results of the property of gravitational attraction or of love and obedience as properties due to the new birth.<p/>
  
    <p>That takes us back to 1947 AD.  A hot topic was whether evolution or creation served as the scientifically correct or better paradigm of origins.  All parties to the debate accepted the necessity of science.  That plausible contract of science seemed then to confer a common ground such that such a debate could come to resolution as a consensus of the side whose arguments were scientific as opposed to the side whose arguments were unscientific.  In reality, the definition of science had evolved from its original definition among the founders of science.  Those founders lived in the century previous to 1700 AD.  The definition of science was evolving such that only experts among scholarly and academic circles actually specified what they meant by science when the debaters engaged by invoking science as the referee.  One of the many casualties which swept the world commonwealth when the Calvary Chapel revolution occurred subsequent to 1960 AD was that  Christians relinquished their previous appeal to invoking science as an arbiter in debates.  That California religion even relinquished analytical rigor or even criticism or negativity of any kind.  The ground for that change among Christian apologists had been prepared by the existentialist movement  among many intellectuals who had relinquished reason, science and rigor  after World War I.  Previous logic of the Enlightenment led to the abandonment of spirituality.  Many Enlightenment thinkers took the Newtonian Physics principle that mathematical analysis meant that if one specified the original conditions of a system exactly that the analyst could know everything about the future condition of the system by projecting the mathematics as far as one wanted into the future.  Those Enlightenment thinkers created Deism from that which made God the creator.  By creating, God made an orderly universe infinitely into the future.  God became irrelevant in that thinking because the world went on forever with reason programmed into the Physics of material reality.  The next step was that God became a superfluous hypothesis.  Once you decided that the world was reality and that all reality was matter in motion, then the search began for what preceded today.    Science entered an infinite regress in search of causes which regressed infinitely into the past and infinitely into the future.  The Enlightenment machine then upset many persons who wished to make room for the individual within the machine.  The phsyics machine looked a lot like the machine of birth, wealth, monarchy, oligarchy, and so on which ground ordinary people into eternal misery.  The Romantic period intended to connect each individual to god pantheistically still without God as the Enlightenment demanded.  While the individual was an obvious fact, so was the machine.  The successors to the Romantic period by 1840 AD or so were inventing statistical mechanics to maintain individuals and preserve the machine and Physics.  Evolution, Freud, Herbert Spencer and Quantum Physics kept the individual but linked the vast population of individuals by occult powerful subjective forces.  The sentiments of individuals joined God, spirituality, reason (if we fast forward to 1970 AD to Calvary Chapel in the US and existentialism in Europe).  Habits or traditions joined the list of irrelevancies of the human condition.  Existentialists and materialists realized that in a world of commercialism that the only thing that mattered was those reptilian brain functions which smart social engineers could manipulate with a combination of pulls such as security and appetite.  Push could be administered by clever manipulations of anxiety, fear, shortages, enemies, need for herding instinct at any cost to reason, spirituality and sentiment.  All that remained was reptilian mind with its needs for gratification.  Reptilian mind could control limbic mind and limbic mind could control cerebral mind.  Habits and traditions went the way of spirituality, sentimentality and reason.  We now find by 2020 AD that while social engineers steer the whole thing by manipulating those statistical expressions of reptilian mind that ordinary people deal in positive sentiment which is good for commerce.  Reason serves as the handmaid of sentiment which serves as the handmaid of reptilian existential needs.  What we have not mentioned is action.  This whole system which drives actions with values that emanate from reptilian mind and control the other parts of human nature constitute a model for living which is contrary to the model which the Logos or Christ provided in most ways if not in all ways.
  
    <p>The creation and evolution debate formed a last attempt of Christians to influence or evangelize their states or world commonwealth.  The original or primitive Christians followed Christ.  Those Christians opposed the Roman empire until the Christians prevailed over the empire.  They then became good citizens in some cases.  Other Christians wanted to reform the church by appealing to the New Testament model directly.  Those separatists and protestants worked relentlessly from within and without.  God predicted in Daniel that there would never be an end to the reign of Christ.  The reign of Christ would include well ordered humans within well ordered groups called churches.  Well-ordered is defined as by the model of Scripture.  The model of Scripture includes all of those parts of human nature that modern society has subtracted in harmonious submission to the commands of God and dictates of love.  A study of origins leads to a study of Godâ€™s plan for the trajectory of material reality.  Once I began the infatuation with evolution and creation, I found myself in the larger debate over science and the Bible.  The debate over science and the Bible leads to the question of what science and the Bible are.  That thinking leads to a study of history.  A study of history leads to a study of eschatology or final things which conclude history.  I am lumping the study of the world before the flood as origins.  We are excluding origins from this study.  The study of history from about 2000 BC to 2000 AD leads to a study of conduct which God demands.  Conduct is the result of love and obedience on the one hand.  Conduct is also the result of not love and not obedience on the other hand.  I appeal to science as the establishment of possible hypotheses in the formulation of a problem.  The science occurs when the rules of evidence and inference eliminate the hypotheses that by the evidence and rules of inference have been proven wrong.<p/>
  
    <p>The hypothesis of this work is that once we accept the Biblical scheme of history from the time of Abraham to Christ that a set of relationships become evident which cannot be explained in any other way than that God has provided a model of conduct for those who are born of God.  To be born of God implies that conduct and that conduct implies to be born of God.  The conduct includes many complex factors which create departures from the ideal as in any data spread.  However, to be truly born again implies a difference between the population of Adam and the part of that population which is born again.  Some modern definitions of science call for simple prediction and experience of success or failure with regard to the prediction.  Many enemies of Christianity and unwitting Christians have participated in conspiracies against the history of the Bible.  Destroying the credibility of Biblical history is most easily done by destroying the chronology of the Bible which then destroys the patterns of history which the Bible evinces when the chronology is correct.  Once the pattern of history is effaced by effacing the chronology, then the pattern of the Christian era ceases to evince the intention of God for the church age to extend the trajectory of God which operated in the Old Testament.  Correct chronology makes the Old Testament history intelligible.  Old Testament history makes the AD or church era history intelligible.  Once we interpret the sweep of history correctly from creation to consummation as an expression of the divine providential sovereignty of God, then we see clearly the model by which God expects those who are born again to live.  When the model is plain, we become conformed to His will rather than outlying data points.  One of the cardinal attributes of science is to know the difference between hypotheses or opinions that might all be true and those which evidence has eliminated.  The point of this study is the history.  During the time since 1947 AD, several researchers have discredited the supposed authorities who have discredited the Bible.    Even before such proof, Christians could have avoided being shaken in faith by examining the false claims for basis in fact.  The attacks upon the chronology and consequently history and consequently imperatives of conduct always did depend upon social authorities who from 1800 AD had nearly infinite amounts of money and political social backing.  They never had science.  In 2020 AD, science has authenticated virtually all of the supposed bad chronology which implied bad history in the Bible.  The intention here is to use chronology as a tool and not the main focus.  Once we assume that the chronology of the Old Testament is accurate, we construct a history from the Old Testament which is a no brainer by many Biblicists.  That leads to the keys which when apply to the history of the world since the incarnation of Christ.  We discover the true pattern of that history.  The history then reveals that history from creation to consummation is driven by a contest between those who live according to a conduct model demanded by God and those who live by many conduct models derived from the world, the flesh and the devil.  We provide a summary title of the scheme of history which occurs between origins and consummation as of 2020 AD on the consummation side.</p>
